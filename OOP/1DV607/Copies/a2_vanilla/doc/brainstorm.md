##Task

Design and implement a simple member registry with CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) functionality. Implementation (Java source code), class- and sequence-diagrams are to be created and presented. The sequence diagrams should show how a model-view separation is achieved (i.e. start in the UI) and how the different requirements are met. The design and implementation should match perfectly.

The focus is not to create a very usable or fancy user interface but to have a robust and well-documented design that can handle change and follows the MVC, GRASP and possibly GoF patterns. The application should be a java console application.

OBS: It is not permitted to use any type of framework, however, the satandard class libraries, etc. are permitted. Basically, you should design and code your own application.

You may work in any way you like. A good process is to design a little, code a little, test a little, then iterate udate and add more. Designing everthing up-front is often hard and requires a lot of experience. Coding everything without a clear (partial) design can lead to problems, esp. in a group setting.
