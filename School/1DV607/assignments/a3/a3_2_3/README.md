All things *should* be covered.   
Im uncertain about the fourth requirement and to what solution is the best and preffered.  

I can have missed certain scenarios with the favoring rules (FavorDealerStrategy, FavorPlayerStrategy), but all the games I've played it's been working well.  
The automatic test cases for the SoftHitStrategy will cause unsuccesful builds whenever another HitStrategy is used.  
If other hit strategies were to be used, the test case would have to be disabled to not cause any issues with the quality testing.
